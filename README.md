This is a repository containing notable projects I have worked on throughout my undergraduate career at the University of Utah.
Here is a list of notable CS courses I have taken with concepts learned in each:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CS 4400 - Computer Systems
- Cross-layer communications between multiple levels of abstraction such as operating systems, assembly code translations, and caching performance.
- Use of operating system concepts such as threads, processes, virtual memory, and signals.
- Implementation of synchronized programs using concurrent and parallel programming techniques.
- Utilization of networking and operating system aspects to create communicating applications.
