This is a repository containing notable projects I have worked on throughout my undergraduate career at the University of Utah.
Here is a list of notable CS courses I have taken with concepts learned in each:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CS 4400 - Computer Systems
- Cross-layer communications between multiple levels of abstraction such as operating systems, assembly code translations, and caching performance.
- Use of operating system concepts such as threads, processes, virtual memory, and signals.
- Implementation of synchronized programs using concurrent and parallel programming techniques.
- Utilization of networking and operating system aspects to create communicating applications.

CS 3710 - Computer Design Lab 
- Use Verilog to implement a "simpler" model of the CR16A Microprocessor.
- Work as a team of 4 to implement in Intel Quartus using modular Verilog and debugging techniques. 
- Design contains: Instruction Set Design, Memory Organization, ALU design, micro-control, and input-output design
- Design an application that will run on the implemented computer.
