This folder contains sample files I wrote for a group FPGA project
at the University of Utah in the Fall 2025 semester. 

This project implements a simplified version of a RISC-based CPU in
Verilog and simple game software for it. The game is a simplified
version of Fruit Ninja that connects a DE1-SOC FPGA board, a Nintendo 
NES controller via GPIO pins, and a VGA monitor via connection port. 

The .V files are Verilog modules that were included in the processor. 
the .ASM files are assembly files for the software
written with respect to a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) we created.
